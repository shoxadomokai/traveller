# Traveller - Trip Planner

Traveller is an SPA built using DarkSky, Geonames and the Pixabay API.

The goal for this was to create a functioning frontend application using Node/Express and Webpack as part of the Udacity Frontend Nanodegree.

## Instructions

Nothing fancy here in terms of installation simply make a fork and work your magic.

### As a Developer

After cloning the repo, cd into the folder and run:

```shell
npm install
```

This will download all the dependencies you need to get the application working.

Enter a location you plan to visit, select the duration of your stay and where you'll be living. The location is converted to co-ordinates using [Geonames](https://www.geonames.org/about.html) API.
